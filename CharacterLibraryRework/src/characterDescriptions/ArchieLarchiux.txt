Description:
Son of [Doxyn Larchiux], Archie Larchiux is a shy, quiet, and timid white crow who rarely ever talks. A battle that happened between Doxyn and Stenfort caused Archie to jump in and take a bullet for his father, which ultimately ended in his death. A golden halo appears above his head now after being resurrected with a special wristwatch that must be monitored and is only worn by Doxyn.
