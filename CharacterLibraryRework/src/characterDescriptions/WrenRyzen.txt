Description: Wren used to work for Dr. Stenfort which wasn’t exactly the best job. He did quit though especially after an accident that happened while handling chemicals that were intended to be given for the incidents. This accident resulted in the chemicals spilling onto his skin which caused the bone to be exposed. The process was rather painless which is surprising.
