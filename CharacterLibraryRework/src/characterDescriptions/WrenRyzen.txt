Description:
Wren worked at the laboratory under Dr. Stenfort, handling a variety of chemicals and substances at that time. His life took a fateful turn during one such experiment when a chemical spill exposed his skin to a hazardous substance, briefly revealing his bone. The exposure was unexpectedly painless, but the incident was enough to make Wren realize that working under Dr. Stenfort was no longer the best option. Tired of being treated as a mere test subject and fed up with the dangerous, toxic environment, he chose to leave Stenfort's service behind.

Wren, although intimidating with his appearance is not a threat. He is a survivor who has endured much and is grateful to still stand strong. His loyalty to the rebellion is unwavering, and while he occasionally wonders about others in the cove, such as Archie, WuffT, and Viraxe, his focus remains clear—helping to stop Dr. Stenfort and the horrors of his experiments. For Wren, it’s not about what’s broken but about the strength found in moving forward, finding purpose, and embracing the family he’s built in the cove.
