Zalfor Tylox is a unpredictable lizzord with a short temper whose mind is constantly at war with itself. He is a bundle of random and unpredictable thoughts (for the most part), torn between ambition, frustration, and an insatiable hunger for validation. As the leader of Lizzord Island, Zalfor’s methods are unpredictable and erratic. While his ultimate goal may be to gain respect and power, he’s often too impulsive to plan it out logically. His emotions—anger, jealousy, and self-loathing—fuel his actions, and that makes him more dangerous because no one ever knows what he’ll do next.

Zalfor's chaotic nature is both his strength and his weakness. He has no clear sense of strategy, yet his actions back fire at times as if he operates on instinct and impulse rather than rational thought. He is the kind of rival who’ll throw out fighting plans as if they were mere distractions, ignoring the consequences of his actions as long as they get him the recognition or victory he craves.

His rivalry with Drex is far from just about territory or resources. Zalfor is driven by an overwhelming need to prove himself, to show that he is worthy of respect. But in his mind, respect isn’t something earned gradually; it’s something to be seized—no matter the cost. Even if it means burning bridges and causing chaos in the process. Zalfor’s frustration with his repeated failures boils over into irrational behavior, causing him to lash out at anyone, even his own kind. Despite the madness and questionable leadership skills, Zalfor’s chaotic actions are nothing more than a desperate, misguided attempt to prove he’s smarter than everyone else.


ENCOUNTER LOG #1- Trying to rule over Dranixion Island for the 10000th time.
Zalfor: [Laughing maniacally]
"Ha! Oh, Drex, you really think you’ve got me figured out, don’t you? Well, guess what? You don’t! You—YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND A SINGLE THING!"

Drex: [Rolling his eyes, trying to keep his cool, even though he’s clearly in a dangerous situation]
"What the hell are you even going on about now, Zalfor? We’re here again? Still stuck on our last little fight? Dude, I don’t have time for this, I’ve got bigger problems today."

Zalfor: [Suddenly stopping, locking eyes with Drex, his voice turning sharp and angry]
"You think I CARE about time, Drex?! Time means nothing when you’ve been overlooked for as long as I have! I’ve been patient! But you—YOU—keep messing up my plans, keep ruining everything I try to build! So now, I’ve had enough!" [Suddenly grabs Drex's cape, his face inches from his rival’s]
"Now, I’m going to make sure you know who’s really in control!"

Drex: [Trying to remain unfazed, looking Zalfor dead in the eye]
"Control? You don’t even know what you’re doing, bruh. You’re just throwing a tantrum, nothing more. What do you think this is gonna accomplish, huh? I've beaten you in battle like 100 times already because you have no idea what you're doing half of the time heh."

Zalfor: [Eyes widening, suddenly letting go of Drex, his voice rising in fevered excitement]
"You think im going to be beaten this time? Oh no, Drex. Not this time! You’ll see, you’ll all see! I don’t need to follow anyone’s rules, not anymore! I’m gonna take what’s mine!" [He suddenly dashes forward trying to get a hit on Drex]
"I’ll show you how quickly things can spiral out of control! Just watch!"

Drex: [He jumps back, gaining position and rubbing his neck, clearly more amused than scared]
"Jeez, calm down, man. You’re all over the place. How am I supposed to take you seriously when you’re just going off the rails?"

Zalfor: [Snarling, now clearly more unhinged]
"You don’t get it, do you? I’m not calm. I’m not rational! And that’s exactly why I’m gonna win! You think you have time to waste, but me? I’m out of patience, Drex!"


Zalfor: [Laughing manically once more]
"THIS IS IT! THIS IS HOW I BREAK YOU! NOT WITH STRATEGY, BUT WITH PURE CHAOS!" [He steps back, watching Drex struggle as the environment  they were both moving around in becomes increasingly hostile. His grin grows wider, more unhinged.]
"You’re gonna break, Drex. I’m going to make you break."

Drex: "Pffff! We'll see about, if you want to get through my island and its people you'll have to get through me first!"
