Description: Incident N-1115 is a unique and enchanting serpent-like creature, distinguished by its ability to emanate an aura of happiness wherever it goes. With a perpetual charming smile and an affinity for playful, gleeful jumps, N-1115 creates an infectious atmosphere of joy. No one fully understands the origins or mechanics behind its aura, but its presence has been proven to elevate the mood of those nearby, often transforming the grumpiest of individuals into someone a little more cheerful.

Despite its otherwise simple appearance, this snake holds a profound impact on emotional well-being. The creature's aura seems to work passively, spreading an uplifting energy without conscious effort, making it a valuable companion in places where morale may be low.

Though N-1115's abilities are widely beneficial, they remain a subject of intrigue. The aura's influence extends beyond just mood—there are instances where individuals experiencing heightened emotions, such as stress or sadness, find their emotions significantly softened in the snake’s presence.

Dr. Stenfort has expressed particular fondness for the creature, considering it a delightful and invaluable companion. This has led to further investigation into whether the snake's ability could have other psychological or therapeutic applications.
